- How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

My design process has evolved through my various projects. This project helped me prioritize requirments as well as keeping my work organized and easy to read. 

- How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The 3D scene consists of many modular functions which played a key role in determining how I write my code. Throughout the projects life, each module consisted of a new technique or function that added to the project. Over the iterations of the 3D project I slowly began to piece each part of the project together until we learned enough to complete the project. At first my development process was just to get the code working and running, after a couple modules I began to keep the code organized and flexible enought to change it on the fly when needed.

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

computational graphics and visualizations have helped me understand more about complex algorithms and concepts. In my future professional pathway my knowledge can help me create for example a complex world for a video game or to show my complex data in a way that is visually understandable.
